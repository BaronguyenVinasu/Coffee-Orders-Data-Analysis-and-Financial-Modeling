## Process
### Data Verification:
- Checked the dataset for missing values (e.g., blank cells in revenue or cost columns).
- Identified and resolved anomalies (e.g., negative values in profit or unrealistic sales figures).

### Data Cleaning:
- Ensured data consistency by standardizing formats (e.g., converting all dates to YYYY-MM-DD).
- Corrected data types (e.g., ensuring revenue and cost columns are numeric).
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries (e.g., test data or placeholder rows).


### Pivot Table Creation:
Built pivot tables to answer key questions:
- Total sales Trends: Summarized monthly revenue and profit by product and region.
- Top 5 customers: Analyzed units sold, revenue, and profit margins by product category.
- Regional Analysis: Aggregated revenue and profit by country (United States, UK...)

## Project Insights
### 1. Sales Trends Over Time
- Sales data from 2019 to 2022 shows a cyclical pattern, with notable peaks in December and July each year.
- The highest recorded monthly sales exceeded $900, primarily driven by Arabica and Excelsa coffee varieties.
- A decline in sales is observed in early 2022, indicating potential external factors such as supply chain disruptions or market saturation.

### 2. Market Performance by Country
- United States is the largest market, generating $35,639 in total sales—over 75% of total revenue.
- Ireland ($6,697) and the United Kingdom ($2,799) contribute smaller but significant portions.
